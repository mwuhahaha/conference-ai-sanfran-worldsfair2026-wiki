# AI Engineer World's Fair 2026 Clean Wiki

Clean AIE-specific World’s Fair 2026 wiki built from the upgraded local project.

This directory keeps:
- generated official schedule pages
- people/company/talk/resource pages
- slide decks and reconstructed slide decks
- RapidOCR-improved OCR text
- livestream transcript bundles
- source summaries and audit receipts
- local scripts needed to rebuild or extend the wiki

This directory intentionally excludes heavyweight regeneration caches:
- `raw/video-cache/`
- `raw/slide-frames-tmp/`
- `raw/experiments/`
- `raw/tmp/`

Use the original `conference-ai-sanfran-worldsfair2026` directory if full video/frame regeneration caches are needed.

## Current Focus

This clean copy is meant to become the AIE-specific conference intelligence version of the World’s Fair wiki: not a generic personal wiki and not only a generated schedule archive.

Read:
- `.ops/plans/worldsfair-aie-specific-conversion-plan.md`
- `.ops/state/current.md`

## Validation

From this directory:

```bash
python3 /garage/obsidian/scripts/generate_calendar.py
```

For link/asset validation, use the command embedded in the conversion plan.
